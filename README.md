# Silver-DofE - Skills

My goal throughout DofE is to improve my ability to use python to solve problems, and gain familiarity with a few different modules with a range of uses, these include: pandas, matplotlib and pygame. I will be working on this for at least one hour a week over a period of 3 months.

## Week Beginning – 07/06/20 Time: 60mins

To begin I finished off my current programming project, a program and UI for encoding and decoding a Vigenère cipher given a keyword. The processing aspect of the program used the functions char() and ord() to shift letters a given amount determined by the keyword. Then using Tkinter I constructed a UI which allowed you to select a mode (Encode/Decode), the keyword and the target text.

## Week Beginning – 14/06/21 Time: 60mins

I took the time this week to consider a few different ideas and plan some projects to have a got at. A few ideas were a calculator program, learning matplotlib with some relevant data and to build a game in python.

## Weeks Beginning – 21/06/21 to 11/07/21 Time: 240mins

Over the next four weeks I focused on a more developed UI for my calculator program with a constantly refreshed display showing the answer/calculation. When the buttons on the calculator are pressed the relevant value is concatenated onto the active string variable which is displayed. When the equals button is pressed the active string is evaluated, and the answer displayed.

This next block of four weeks was spent learning how to use and customise graph plotting with matplotlib with some file reading to get the data. To start with I installed the module and just tried getting a line and some point on the scree n and understanding the syntax.

Then I wanted to apply this to some real world data and see the trends it presented. So using daily case changes for COVID-19, matplotlib and pandas produced this graph.

This shows the first three waves from last year. The main difficulty was manipulating the x-axis to ensure not to many data labels were shown at once and rotated 90 degrees. Over the next two weeks I worked on a program that would compare carbon dioxide emissions between two countries entered by the user.  The first show in blue, the second in red.

In this example The United Kingdom is shown in Blue and France shown in Red.
