# Silver-DofE - Skills

My goal throughout DofE is to improve my ability to use python to solve problems, and gain familiarity with a few different modules with a range of uses, these include: pandas, matplotlib and pygame. I will be working on this for at least one hour a week over a period of 3 months.

To begin I finished off my current programming project, a program and UI for encoding and decoding a Vigenère cipher given a keyword. The processing aspect of the program used the functions char() and ord() to shift letters a given amount determined by the keyword. Then using Tkinter I constructed a UI which allowed you to select a mode (Encode/Decode), the keyword and the target text.

I took the time this week to consider a few different ideas and plan some projects to have a got at. A few ideas were a calculator program, learning matplotlib with some relevant data and to build a game in python.

Over the next four weeks I focused on a more developed UI for my calculator program with a constantly refreshed display showing the answer/calculation. When the buttons on the calculator are pressed the relevant value is concatenated onto the active string variable which is displayed. When the equals button is pressed the active string is evaluated, and the answer displayed.
